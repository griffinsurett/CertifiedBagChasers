I'm the best-selling author of Managing the Motion of Money: Simple Steps to Secure a Future of Financial Freedom—a book I wrote to help people build clarity, discipline, and confidence around money and markets.

Through my work closely alongside market participants across Wall Street, I've gained firsthand exposure to how professionals think about **risk, price action, market structure, and decision-making under pressure.** That experience taught me that success in markets isn't about predictions or shortcuts—it's about frameworks, process, and consistency.

I'm also a **Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Level I**, with a deep focus on technical analysis and market behavior. My approach blends professional-grade insights with clear communication, helping others understand why markets move and how to make smarter financial decisions over time.

**My mission is simple:** to guide and educate people toward long-term financial success—not through hype or get-rich-quick schemes, but through proven principles, disciplined thinking, and systems that actually work.
